    However, Joichiro closed it in order to travel abroad for 2 or 3 years and send his son Soma to an Elite Culinary School called Totsuki Culinary Academy.

    After Soma graduated, Joichiro passed ownership of the restaurant to Soma, who opens the restaurant only on an irregular schedule, as he spends most of his time traveling overseas, accepting invitations to cook from all over the world.`
