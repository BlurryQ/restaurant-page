    However, Jōichirō closed it in order to travel abroad for 2 or 3 years and send his son Sōma to an Elite Culinary School called Tōtsuki Culinary Academy.

    After Sōma graduated, Jōichirō passed ownership of the restaurant to Sōma, who opens the restaurant only on an irregular schedule, as he spends most of his time traveling overseas, accepting invitations to cook from all over the world.`
